Game Features

    A classic Snake game with intuitive controls.
    The snake grows longer after consuming food.
    Game over when the snake hits the wall or itself.
    A randomly generated food item for each turn.

How to Play

    Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
    The snake starts moving in the chosen direction when the game begins.
    The goal is to collect the food items represented by a character on the screen (e.g., '*').
    Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player's score increases.
    Avoid hitting the walls or colliding with the snake's own body, as this ends the game.
    Try to achieve the highest score possible and challenge your friends!
